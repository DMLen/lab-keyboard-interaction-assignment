in solution 1, a command key is added to the keyboard. the words "save", "undo", "copy and "redo" in addition with a command key will be recognized as commands.

in solution 2, triple-clicking on C, U, S or R will respectively input the commands copy, undo, save and redo.

in solution 3, writing "save" and selecting it from the candidate list will ask if you wish to run save as a command. same works for other commands. technically similar to solution 1 as we are hijacking the candidate selection function with a string comparison.
